"bring me solutions not problems" is the kind of cargo-cult leadership that sounds great on linkedin but falls apart in the real world. this toxic bit of corporate wisdom masquerades as empowerment while actually destroying trust and collaboration that great engineering teams are built on. 

## morale death spiral

here's a classic scenario that plays out in tech companies and startups everywhere.

an engineer comes to you, a leader: "the team is burning out from all of the turnover/feature farming/etc"

you, an intellectual: "what solutions have you tried to pull out of burnout?"

the engineer: "well, i've tried handling my own work/life balance / talking to peers / etc. maybe we need more people? or maybe encourage time off or a break?"

you: "that's not in the budget. come back with a solution we can actually implement."

the engineer never brings it up again. a few months later, several experienced engineers quit  and your feature farm is now a mosquito pasture. nobody likes mosquitos.

**what actually happened**

- your engineer tried to warn you about a systemic issue
- you punted it back because it wasn't a gift-wrapped solution
- the engineer interpreted your response as "leadership doesn't care about wellbeing"
- the problem festered until it turned into attrition

morale issues are often symptoms of structural problems that individual contributors _can't_ solve alone. when someone brings up team morale, they're usually the canary in the coal mine - the only one bringing it up. 

## the real problem

when you tell your team "don't bring me problems", here's what they hear:

> i don't want to be bothered with your challenges.

> i care more about appearing decisive than making good decisions

> i'd rather have hidden disasters than visible problems

your solution-first mandate doesn't do what you think it does. it doesn't promote independence, it creates a culture of isolation and fear.

**something nobody ever says** in this argument, in particular to engineering, is that their job is to solve problems. why do leaders pick and choose when they stereotype engineers as problem solvers vs. whiners?

## the fallout

when organizations use this leadership cop-out, i've seen this happen:

- engineers implement quick fixes instead of addressing root causes
  - it has been shown to them that nobody cares about systemic issues
- people waste time crafting perfect 'solutions' to present instead of collaborating early
- knowledge siloing becomes the norm because everyone is afraid to admit they need help
- tech debt accumulates because systemic issues never surface until they're unignorable crises

## doing your job

a radical idea for leadership to resolve this issue:

- create psychological safety for raising concerns early
- help frame and investigate problems
- connect people and resources to solve complex issues
- actually give a damn

if you're still clinging hard to "bring me solutions", you may be suffering from:

- avoiding hard work of actual leadership
- optimizing for your convenience rather than team efficacy
- compensating from an insecurity

## but engineers are whiny!

yeah, they can be, but you signed up for this as a leader. if you can't differentiate between complaints (never a good enough solution) and problems (have a solution), you need to reevaluate.

as a lead, this is how i quickly differentiate:

engineer: "i have a problem with X"

me: "sorry to hear that's nagging you. in an ideal world, what does this look like?"

this quick test helps me understand if someone needs to vent or needs expectation resetting vs. there being an underlying issue they need help with.

while your job isn't to become the solution vending machine, it is to build an environment where problems can be discovered early, discussed openly, and solved collaboratively.

## bottom line

**you are the coach, not the referee.** it's time to retire this approach and build a culture where problems are seen as opportunities for collaboration, not failures of independence.
