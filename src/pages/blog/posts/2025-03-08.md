i've been using (mostly) the same machine setup for the past 5-7 years and after setting up a new machine this week, i finally branched out and replaced some of my old defaults.

my personal machine is a macbook pro 16" m3 max with a crapload of RAM.

## core overhauls

on a macbook, there are 2 things you need: **xcode** and **ruby**. both can notoriously be a pain in the ass, especially if you do mobile development. these are the first two things i overhaul.

### ruby

i use [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) with [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install) to easily manage ruby versions.

```bash
# install them
brew install chruby ruby-install

# setup chruby
source $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh

# [optional] turn off the documentation install on gems by default
echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc

# install latest ruby
ruby-install ruby

# switch to whatever latest version
chruby ruby-3.4.2
# set it here so chruby will automatically switch to it
echo "ruby-3.4.2" > ~/.ruby-version
```

if you want chruby to always auto switch to whatever version you set as default in `~/.ruby-version`, add this to your `.zshrc` file:

```bash
source $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh
```

### xcode

i really hate installing xcode. fortunately, [xcodes](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/XcodesApp) makes it really easily to install and update different versions of xcode and their runtimes for iOS, etc.

```bash
# install
brew install --cask xcodes

# install latest xcode version
xcodes install --latest --no-superuser

# switch to that as default
sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app

# accept license
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

**note** that if you have multiple versions of xcode, when you run `xcode-select -switch` you may have to provide the version number extension.

```bash
xcode-select -swtich /Applications/Xcode/16.2.0.app
```

xcodes can also install runtimes for iOS, etc. for mobile development.

### useful tooling

i navigate around my machine using a terminal most of the time. over the years i've come across a couple of tools that have made life a lot easier.

- **[asimov](https://github.com/stevegrunwell/asimov)**: if you use filevault, it will not store dependency directories like `node_modules` or `vendor/` in there
- **[mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)**: install app store apps from the command line
- **[direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)**: load/unload env vars based on the current directory
- gnu tools, all of them

### programs

here are all the programs i use:

- **[1Password](https://1password.com/)**: password management
- **[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)**: terminal
- **[Anytype](https://anytype.io/)**: the way i describe it is the midpoint between notion and obsidian
