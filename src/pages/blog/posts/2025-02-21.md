if capitalism is going to exploit me, i'm going to take advantage of the free market while i still can. financial literacy is paramount to thriving in this system, which is why they refuse to teach it in American public education.

i've been privileged enough to get to a place where i can build an aggressive (high-risk, high-potential-reward) stock portfolio.

historically, this portfolio grows by ~22%/year on average, but has big swings up and down along the way. to put it in real terms:

- **$10,000** in this portfolio in 2012 -> **~$135,000** by early 2025
- during its worst period, it dropped 28% in value, so a $10,000 investment would temporarily drop to $7,200
  - in this case, this happened during the post-COVID inflation period
  - it took ~9 months for this portfolio to recover back to its previous high

**being able to add an extra 0 to that 10k is alluring**, but this kind of investing only works if you can stomach watching your money temporarily drop by large amounts and not panic-sell.

</summary>

when you buy broad market funds like these, you're buying pieces of hundreds or thousands of companies. many of these companies have practices or political stances you may not agree with. the unfortunate reality is that it's nearly impossible to invest without some connection to companies that conflict with your values.

### there is no ethical consumption under capitalism

whether you're purchasing products or investing in the market, you are participating in the same system. for every day i work, my taxed wages fund actions i personally never consented to or voted for. if i'm already forced to participate in this system, i am going to understand how to use its mechanisms to build security for myself and others.

financial security can help me actively participate more effectively in collective action.

## üîç portfolio rationale

my portfolio is 90% stocks and 10% bonds, with diversification across US and international markets.

### üèõÔ∏è core holdings (60%)

#### Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) - 35%

- tracks the top 100 companies on Nasdaq
  - e.g. big tech like Apple (AAPL), as well as non-tech growth leaders like Costco (COST)
- strong global revenue streams and high growth potential.

#### Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) - 25%

- holds stocks from other countries
  - e.g. Toyota (TM), Samsung (SSNLF), Louis Vuitton (LVMHF)
- helps protect against US-specific economic risks
- benefits from currency diversification when the US dollar weakens

### üöÄ growth engine (15%)

#### NVIDIA (NVDA) - 15%

- (currently) the leading AI chip company
- since its a single company stock, this is the riskiest part of my portfolio
- well-positioned in key-growth areas (AI, gaming, data)
  - can act as a force multiplier for returns if AI trends continue

with the risk does come reward potential, i've held NVDA because it's had the highest return in my portfolio overall.

üîÑ if you'd rather not invest in a single company stock, i'd recommend reallocating the 15% to **QQQ** (NVIDIA is one of the top holdings on QQQ anyway).

### üèóÔ∏è stabilizers and growth base (25%)

#### S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) - 15%

- focused on fast-growing US companies in the S&P 500 index
  - has some overlap with QQQ, but it also contains other companies like Visa (V) and Eli Lily (LLY)
- concentrated in tech and momentum stocks

üîÑ alternatively, consider **Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)**:

- tracks _all_ S&P 500 companies (not just growth)
  - e.g. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is in VOO but not SPYG
- more diversified across mature businesses and slow but steady growth rates
- VOO is a bit less volatile

my entire Roth IRA is in VOO, which is why it's not in this portfolio.

#### Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) - 10%

- holds corporate bonds
  - think of this like lending money to big companies in exchange for interest payments
- helps during stock market volatility
- lower risk, lower reward

## ‚öñÔ∏è risk management

while the focus of this portfolio is aggressive growth, it's important to understand how to manage its risks.

### 1. regular rebalancing

- i do a quarterly portfolio review to maintain target allocations
  - for example, if NVDA grows to 20% of my portfolio, i'll sell some to get back to 15%
  - guarantees me a small return and less loss potential if NVDA goes down

### 2. dollar-cost averaging

- invest fixed amounts regularly instead of dumping large amounts of money in at a time
  - this reduces market impact-- this is what makes stocks swing
  - for example, i allocate a percentage of my paycheck to my brokerage account

### 3. emergency fund

**do this before building a portfolio.** you will thank yourself if something ever happens.

- have 3-6 months of expenses in a high-yield savings account
  - examples of banks with typically higher yields: wealthfront, marcus, sofi
- this helps avoid selling during market downturns

a HYSA is important. let your money generate money. i use [wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com). at the time of writing, the APY is 4%. [feel free to use my referral link, we will both get an extra 0.5% APY for 3 months](https://www.wealthfront.com/c/affiliates/invited/AFFA-XA41-V5C5-SR0N).

## üîÆ the future

this portfolio isn't set in stone. factors that might lead me to adjust it:

- major life changes (like buying a house or career changes)
- significant shifts in the market or economy
- emerging investment opportunities
- changes in my risk tolerance

the key is having a clear rationale for any changes and not making emotional decisions during market volatility.
